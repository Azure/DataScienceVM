# Contributed Extensions for the Data Science VM

## About
This area  contains community contributed extensions for the Data Science VM (DSVM). Building extensions for DSVM is straightforward since we can leverage all Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates and VM custom extension mechanisms. 
You can find more information on building extensions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/overview). 

You can also checkout some extensions already developed by the Data Science VM team in the [parent directory](https://github.com/Azure/DataScienceVM/tree/master/Extensions). 

We invite you to develop extensions to the DSVM and send us the pointers so we can feature it here for the benefit of the user community. 

## Extensions

This extension enables neuroimaging scientists to have easy access to scalable computing and storage resources on the cloud for their research projects and combine it with the rich data science, machine learning and analytics toolset on the DSVM.
