# Data Science Virtual Machine

The Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM) is a customized VM image on Microsoftâ€™s Azure cloud built specifically for doing data science. It has many popular data science and other tools pre-installed and pre-configured to jump-start building intelligent applications for advanced analytics. It is available for [Windows Server 2016](http://aka.ms/dsvm/win2016) and [Ubuntu 16.04 LTS](http://aka.ms/dsvm/ubuntu). We also offer [Windows Server 2012](http://aka.ms/dsvm) and [CentOS](http://aka.ms/dsvm/centos) versions, although Windows 2016 and Ubuntu are the recommended options. You can try the Data Science VM for free for 30 days (with $200 credits) with a free [Azure Trial](http://azure.com/free). The Linux (Ubuntu-based) DSVM also provides a test drive through a button on the [product page](http://aka.ms/dsvm/centos). The Test Drive will provide full access to you own instance of the VM with just a free Microsoft account (No Azure subscription or CC needed). 

# About this Repo

On this repo, we will feature tools, tips and extensions (see below) to the Data Science VM. We invite the DSVM user community to contribute any useful tools or scripts, extensions you may have written to enhance the user experience on the DSVM. 

# About Extensions
Azure Resource manager (ARM) provides a capability to define extensions for resources like Virtual Machines. VM Extensions are scripts that are run during the deployment of a VM to install additional pieces of software or reconfigure the VM to your needs or to comply with specific IT policies your company may have.
