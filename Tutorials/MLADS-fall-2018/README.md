# MLADS Tutorial

This tutorial was presented at MLADS (Machine Learning and Data Science), Microsoft's internal machine learning conference, in the fall of 2018. It is a hands-on tutorial on deep learning that focuses on image classification with CIFAR-10 and AzureML. It has several hands-on components:

1. Log in to AzureML.
2. Download CIFAR-10.
3. Build a model locally.
4. Operationalize the model.

There are also two demos: run the same model on a BatchAI cluster and tune the hyperparemeters with HyperDrive.

You can run this tutorial on your own Ubuntu DSVM by deploying the ARM template in the *setup* directory. Once your VM is created, log in to JupyterHub and navigate to the *MLADS-fall-2018* directory. The Jupyter notebooks are designed to be easy to follow along.
