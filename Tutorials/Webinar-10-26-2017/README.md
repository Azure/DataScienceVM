# This directory contains the assets that were covered in the live webinar on October 26, 2017.

The webinar was titled "AI Development in Azure using Data Science Virtual Machines". 

The notebooks and other material require a Windows DSVM to run properly. 

The distributed example from the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit also requires a [Batch AI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/batch-ai/) account with a cluster configured to use the Ubuntu DSVM as the base image.
